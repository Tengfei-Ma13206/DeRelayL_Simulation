Decentralizde Relay Learning: decentralized AI model training system using Blockchain

# DeRelayL Simulation README

## Key Principles

In the era of large-scale models, fully utilizing personal data—especially data unavailable on the internet—requires a carefully designed incentive mechanism. This simulation focuses on the following key principles:

1. **Incentivizing Contributions**: Designing mechanisms that encourage individuals to willingly contribute their data and computational power to large-scale models, with the promise of improved model performance as a tangible benefit.

2. **Fundamental Assumptions for Sustainability**:
   - The primary goal for all participants is to achieve better-performing models.
   - The majority of participants act honestly. Dishonest behaviors are naturally filtered out, as the majority will ignore and not acknowledge contributions from dishonest participants.

## Simulation Focus

This simulation demonstrates the core concepts of DeRelayL by:
- Highlighting how individual contributions lead to collective model improvement.
- Showcasing the mechanisms that ensure dishonest participants are excluded from the system.
- Emphasizing the transparency of model versioning and reward distribution to maintain trust and sustainability.

## Conclusion

DeRelayL provides a sustainable framework for decentralized collaborative model training, leveraging individual contributions effectively while ensuring system integrity. By focusing on incentivizing honest participation and filtering out dishonest behavior, DeRelayL creates a robust ecosystem for achieving high-performing models collaboratively.
